* Summary: 
*  This is a summary of assignment 10 for the first week
*
* Estimated:  1.0 hrs   
* Actual:     1.2 hrs
*
*  The most difficult part was learning, familiarizing with the Linux servers. 
*  I don't have any familarity with Linux or command line. 
*  So, it was very much a crash course on another language in addition to learning C++.
